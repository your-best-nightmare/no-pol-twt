# no-pol-twt
**no-pol-twt** is an extension for Chrome and Brave that attempts to remove any and all politics off of X (formerly known as Twitter). This extension is hosted only here, on this page, and it is not available in the Chrome Web Store or any other equivalent.

As of writing this, all the extension does is remove any tweet that mentions **Trump**, as doing anything beyond that is far beyond my technical knowledge. Any and all forks are welcome!

**Note: The extension is only meant to work on Chrome, but may work on other Chromium-based browsers**

## Installation / Usage
Using this extension is quite simple. Download this repository as a .zip file on your computer and extract it into a dedicated subfolder and delete the README.md (this file).

After that, open Chrome and type in `chrome://extensions`. There, you need to locate and turn on **Developer Mode** if it isn't enabled already. After that, press the "Load unpacked" button and select the folder where you extracted the files to. It is important to note that you have to select the entire folder.

Upon finishing all of that, you're free to use the extension as you see fit.

## Contributing
Everyone who deems themself fit is more than welcome to report issues, help out with contributions, fork this repo and similar things that help push this extension further.
